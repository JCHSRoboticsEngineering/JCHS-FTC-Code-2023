/**
 * This is NOT an opmode.
 *
 * This class can be used to define all the specific hardware for a single robot.
 * In this case that robot is a modified Pushbot that we call Rabbot.
 * See PushbotTeleopTank_Iterative and others classes starting with "Pushbot" for usage examples.
 *
 * This hardware class assumes the following device names have been configured on the robot:
 * Note:  All names are lower case and some have single spaces between words.
 *
 * Motor channel:  Left front  drive motor:  "left_front_drive"
 * Motor channel:  Right front drive motor:  "right_front_drive"
 * Motor channel:  Left back drive motor:    "left_back_drive"
 * Motor channel:  Right back drive motor:   "right_back_drive"
 * Motor channel:  Intake motor:             "intake_wheel"
 * Motor channel:  Shooter motor:            "shooter_wheel"
 * Servo channel:  Wobble holding arm:       "wobble_arm"
 * Servo channel:  Wobble holding claw:      "wobble_claw"
 * Servo channel:  Servo to angle the ramp:  "shooter_angler"
